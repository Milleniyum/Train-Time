# Train-Time
Train Time displays a list of trains, the destination, how frequently they arrive, the next arrival time, and the number of minutes until that arrival.

The information provided by Train Time would be very useful to commuters looking to get to their destinations on time.

To get started, enter the name of a train, its destination, the first train time of the day in HH:mm, and how frequently the train arrives in minutes. Click submit and your entered train will display in the table above with a calculated Next Arrival time and number of Minutes Away.
